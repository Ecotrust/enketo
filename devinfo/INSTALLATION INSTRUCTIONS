1. Install Code Igniter e.g. with the following structure:
	enketo____ Code_Igniter
		|			|______ application
		|			|______ system
		|
		|_____ public (this is the webroot that contains index.php)

2. Fix two paths in index.php, test if installation works, application/logs and application/cache should be writeable
3. Replace application directory 
4. Copy enketo files in /public (overwrite index.php)
5. Create wildcard subdomain that points to /public
